Ngày Chiến Thắng

Ngày Chiến Thắng is a newspaper-style project created by a small learning team. Our goal is to tell stories from the Vietnam War — stories filled with empathy, humanity, and resilience. We believe these accounts deserve to be shared and appreciated by more people.

This project is built as a simple Front-End website. Through it, our team aims to:
* Practice and strengthen our fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Explore the design aspects of building a website
* Deliver a meaningful learning experience while honoring history
